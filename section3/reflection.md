## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

2 things that where brand new to me was :

1. staying in your own learning path and focus on yourself. Meaning don't compare
yourself to others. This is new to me because it can be discouraging to compare your
path to others because they can either understand the subject faster then you or ahead of you
and by you trying to compare to them will just bring your self-esteem down. So never compare your learning career with others just focus on what you can do to improve everyday!

2. In the video provide the spokesperson Karman stated "When you struggle is when you start learning". That stuck to me because since very I was little I always had a negative way of looking at things when I did not understand something. From the video I took that is always good to struggle in situation because thats how you'll progress better and understand things better because you will have to just work harder and be more productive to achieve the understanding of something.   

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

One way I show growth mindset is by not giving up. i feel like I have this mindset because Ive had a lot of situations in my life that giving up was not option this made me look at things a different way then just saying I cant do it. I believe in life if you want something you will do what it takes to get it as long as I keep going thats all that matters. One way i do not show growth mindset is. Getting Stuck on a situation and not have ways or a plan to figure out something I struggle very often.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

A mobile application that can have arrays is Instagram. A way that it has array is by
having your post, amount of comments, and amount of likes the post have.

```javascript
var yourPost = ["Loved my vacation", 10, 50];
```

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are methods in the array that you can execute with in the array
for example you can use array methods where you can remove, add, and access the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is a loop is something helpful to repeat something as many times as you like. With conjunction we want to check for something or conditions to be meet over a data set. Without When we want something to run a number of time or until a condition is meet.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
loop is like repeating something that your used to over and over again. for example when you go to school you would most likely have in a backpack before leaving is pencils, notebooks, homework. Thats a loop because thats something you reapeat over and over to be prepared in class

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I struggled in this section I'm still not getting the methods for arrays and the way they should be executed as well as for loops. I don't really know which loops and array methods are used more commonly.
