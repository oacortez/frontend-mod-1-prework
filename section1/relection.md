## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Something I already did was have a growth-mindset. When I have a goal I am very open-minded on what I want to do. Gives
me motivation but as well more room for improvement and as well have to go back and check which I abilities I acquired I can strengthen more to improve my goal/task. In the article I read some new things I want to adapt to my learning journey. One of the things is read a lot more often. I want to adapt this because I struggle to read and get the information from what I read. This is due because of not reading often. Another one is learning how to take breaks and learning to take care of my brain. Having to learn this will be hard since I hardly like to take breaks unless I finished the task but by doing the 20-20-20 rule will be very crutial for me to learn how to take breaks and for taking care of my brain I will need to learn how to eat more healthier and be more wise on what to drink and what snacks/food I should consume instead of eating foods that wont benifit my body and brain. All this will be crutial and hard but by doing this constantly it will improve me as a better developer!   

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

data types are types of data which you process using your computer program meaning you can give something a data or you can make the program give you a data.

some of the data types I learned was
1) numbers : Numbers in data type can be any positive number, negative number, and long numbers
ex : 7 , -8 , 2021

2) floating numbers : these are the same as numbers but they are decimal numbers they as well can be positive or negative.
ex: 0.25, -0.50

3) string : a string is a data type where you can write in letters, characters , and numbers but they either have to be wrapped around double quotes " " or single quotes ' '

ex: "I am a string"
'I am also a string '
" \(~.~)/ "
"872837"
'Hi ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©'

boolean: booleans are a data type which tells you two values whether one thing is either true or false.
ex : 2===10 // this would be false since 3 and 10 are not the exact number
 4===4 // this would be true since theyre the same number
 9 > 12 // this would be true since 9 is less than 12



3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
I would create a variable with a variable name and assign the value which would be "Hello World "
 ex : var value = "Hello World!";
 console.log(value);


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? The characters you would use to comment out in JavaScript are "//" which is single-line comment  or " /* with */" which is multi-line comments. The purpose to use comments are for your personal use to explain what your code does and be easier to understand if its just for you or for others that you share your code is able to read any directions or explanations of your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is like a empty box that you can give it a name and put your favorite candy into and as well take out. it doesnt always have to be candy it can be toys and other things that you like.   

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

One app I use a lot is instagram 3 variables that are used are:
1) a variable that would require a email - this would be a data type of string
2) a variable that would require your age - this would would be a data type of numbers
3) a variable that would require if my password is correct or not - this would be a data type of boolean

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
concatenation is where you you would join two data types together like strings, numbers, variables, etc. meaning in code you will be using the "+" character to join both data types together.
ex: var name = "oscar"
var age = 22
console.log("hello my name is " + name + " " + " I am " + age + " " + "years old!")

this example we concatenated a string, variable , and a number.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I believe the site google uses a lot of concatenation because people often look for more then one thing for example in google I could be looking for a place to eat in a location that I am so I would search for something like Places to eat near me. This would create a concatenation because it would look for my location + restaurants near me.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
1) When is it best to use concatenation and interpolation when working on a project?
2) do we use var most common when using a variable or do we use more "const" or "let" ?
3) how can I come up with better methods to create variable names to keep it balance?
