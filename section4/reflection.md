something## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My work flow improved a little bit. The Pomodoro technique was a bit challenging
because I was never used to something like this. But I tried my best to stick to it
and will try it more commonly as I go.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

It went well because I actually could focus at least on one task and what I needed to achieve even if it was just one task at a time I had the motivation to finish it instead of thinking of other task to finish I just had to focus on one and not overthink and waste time.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects represent a special data type that is changeable and can be used to store a collection of data. Arrays are different because even tho they're kinda the same the difference is that it collects ordered data they can be accessed by their numerical position on the list.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
I think object would be the best on this because since were creating a list of students we would probably need to create objects of every student and there names

  * List of states and their capitals
  This would used as a object because we need to store data for the state and with every state we need to add their own capital.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  This we would use a array because we can just list in a array of data of things that are been taken to pack for a vacation

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
I believe a object would be best since a array would take a lot of space and would not be dry code plus with object we can store multiple names and perhaps comments,likes,etc.

  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object would be best for this one because this will be more cleaner and can perhaps divid the students but maybe there last names or first name

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
Object would be the best option because since were are creating values that help us bake a cake for example we can just store all the values in one object and once we call it it would just give us all the Ingredients and as well each amount of the ingredients to put in to bake a cake.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  this would be perfect for a array because we can just store all my favorite restaurants in one array and each one of the index would represent to my personal favorite to the last one would be as a recommendation.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Another app that would use the same object would be for example the chipotle app since it would have a object of the user and values such as timeStamp, payment, userName, etc.


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Im still very confused on all of section4 I struggled with class and there methods/properties and how to use them properly as well with objects and methods. Is this something that we will be practice more and explain better ? or is this something we will have to know by mod 1 ?
