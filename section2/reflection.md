## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel timid when it comes to asking questions because I always had the feeling of always asking
obvious questions as well as been in a environment that I don't know anybody or have
the confidence to do so. I do intend to ask more questions sooner then later I feel like
as developer is very crucial to ask questions even if is dumb. I know for a fact I will have to
because it will spark a boost on my confidence to ask even more questions in the long run.


1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It felt good/bad at the same time. It was uncomfortable at first since I did not really know most of the subjects and know if the information that I got was accurate or not since there can be many ways of finding your resource.
Later on I felt good about because it gave me a good rewarding feeling once I found the right resource and actually
understand what I was trying to look and learn from. It supported my learning by giving me different scenarios on
how to look up something either from a website or a video and each site or video always have different ways too look
at a certain problem and as well solutions.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is basically a code block that performs different actions based
on the scenarios that is giving too. I believe in any web application if it requires for example a logging
and password and it doesn't match the information that you give. It will return you a error/unable to find user but if
you did everything correct then it will let you in the application. I believe that is a for of conditional statement.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an __if__ statement you will have to use __AND__ `&&`. As well as __OR__ `||`.
For example >&&. Returns true if __both__ of the statements are true but if one of those statements is false then it will only be false till both are true. If it's a statements that is both false it will return false and not true. The >|| is a bit different because the operator only returns false when both of its operands are false.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Some of the tools that you can use are if you want to check if two conditions are met is by using logical operators
this will help you determine if both are true or false or if one of them is just true or false as well by using the __AND__ `&&` operator. As well as __OR__ `||` operator. Another operator you can use to check if 1 or 2 of the conditions are met is by using the comparison operator this operators will help you determine if 1 or 2 of the conditions are met by using these syntax : `>, <, <=, >=, !==, ===`.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
1. How to find easier ways to give your functions a name
2. Which operators are used more often in code ? and what type of web applications are to use it more common?
3. Is it always a good idea to have else in your if statements if both true or false don't apply ?
